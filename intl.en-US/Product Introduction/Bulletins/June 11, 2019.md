## Support for Container Service Swarm is ending {#section_9i0_egb_1uj .section}

After December 31, 2019, Alibaba Cloud will no longer provide technical support Container Service Swarm. However, you can continue to use Container Service Kubernetes and enjoy stable and reliable enterprise-class services. We recommend that you migrate your applications in advance according to the following information:

1.  From July 1, 2019, Swarm clusters cannot be created in the Container Service console. If you have special requirements, open a ticket.
2.  From December 31, 2019, console functions and documentation that are related to Swarm clusters will be brought offline. You can manage your existing Swarm clusters by calling API actions.

For information about how to migrate applications from Swarm clusters to Kubernetes clusters, see [Migration solution overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Best Practices/Migrate applications from a Swarm cluster to a Kubernetes cluster/Migration solution overview.md#).
