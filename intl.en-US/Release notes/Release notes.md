|High-density deployment supported by the new Terway plug-in|The new version of the Terway plug-in is available. It supports both the exclusive ENI mode and the inclusive ENI mode. The default mode is the inclusive ENI mode. -   Exclusive ENI mode: In this mode, the number of deployed pods must match the number of the created ENIs on each node. This mode can improve network performance.
-   Inclusive ENI mode: In this mode, you can have multiple container instances corresponding to one ENI. This mode improves the container deployment density of a single node.

 |All|[Terway network plugin](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network management/Terway network plugin.md#)|
|Adding support for the Knative framework|Knative is a serverless framework based on Kubernetes. Knative is used to create a serverless orchestration standard for deploying cloud-native and cross-platform services. Knative implements this serverless standard by integrating container or function creation, workload management \(auto scaling\), and event models. ACK introduces the Knative deployment feature, which can help to install and upgrade the Build, Serving, and Eventing components. You must deploy Istio before using the Knative feature. A wizard for deploying sample applications and solutions for tracing, monitoring, and logging are also provided.|All|[Knative overview](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Knative management/Knative overview.md#)[Use Knative to deploy a Hello World application](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Knative management/Use Knative to deploy a Hello World application.md#)|
|Adding support to search by node IP addresses and pod IP addresses|Searching for a pod by node IP address and pod IP address is supported. In the management console, choose **Application** \> **Pods** and specify the node IP address or pod IP address to manage a pod.|All|None.|

 |[EN-US\_TP\_15496.md\#](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Overview.md#)|
|Genomics computing cluster that is designed for genomics computing|Container Service has launched the genomics computing clusters for Dedicated Kubernetes. The clusters contain the worker nodes that use high-performance ECS instances and supports the workflow engine of high specification. It allows you to process a large amount of batch genomics computing tasks in the following file formats: BCL, FASTQ, BAM, SAM, and VCF. Genomic computing tasks include genomic data analysis, alignment, and mutation detection. In the management console, choose **Clusters** \> **Clusters**, and click Create Kubernetes Cluster. On the Select Cluster Template page, select the **Dedicated Genomics Computing Cluster** template to create the Dedicated Genomics Kubernetes cluster.|All|None.|
|Adding support for image and video encoding acceleration in FPGA clusters|Container Service has launched FPGA clusters, which use FPGA F3 instances as worker nodes. An FPGA cluster is suitable to perform video and image computing tasks, such as encoding videos with the H.265 standard and converting JPEG images to HEIF images. The time spent on implementing FPGA solutions of video encoding is reduced from one week to 15 minutes. This significantly saves the CDN bandwidth for the bitrate of transcoding and optimization of non-compression video quality. In the management console, choose **Clusters** \> **Clusters**, and click Create Kubernetes Cluster. On the Select Cluster Template page, select the **Dedicated FPGA Cluster** template to create the Dedicated FPGA Kubernetes cluster.|All|None.|
|New version of Cloud Controller Manager \(CCM\)|The CCM component is upgraded to v1.9.3.110-g4938309-aliyun, which supports more features of SLB configurations. This version contains the following new features: -   You can configure parameters to limit whether SLB instances located in the public network can be created.
-   You can change the certificate ID.
-   You can specify a VSwitch when attaching an SLB instance located in the internal network to a service.
-   You can configure to forward SLB traffic from HTTP over port 80 to HTTPS over port 443.

 |All|[Changes to Cloud Controller Manager](../../../../intl.en-US/Release notes/Changes to Cloud Controller Manager.md#)|
|Upgrading to Istio 1.1.4 to access Time Series and Spatial-Temporal Database \(TSDB\).| ACK Istio 1.1.4 improves self-recovery capability. In this version, the control panel can automatically recover, and earlier versions can automatically be upgraded. ACK Istio 1.1.4 also provides the ability to access TSDB. TSDB is a database service that integrates efficient read/write, compressed storage, and real-time computing capabilities of sorted data. To address the pain points of Prometheus local storage, you can integrate Prometheus with ACK Istio 1.1.4 and use a remote storage adapter to connect a TSDB instance. This type of instances offers remote storage services with high performance, stability, and reliability at low costs.

 Compared with open-source remote storage solutions, this solution is easier to use. You only need to change the Prometheus configuration because it has high integration with ACK Istio and does not require installation and deployment of adapters. This solution supports parallel reads and writes and is highly compatible with Prometheus Query Language \(PromQL\). It also offers the auto scaling capability of distributed storage systems.

 |All|None.|
|Adding support to synchronize images across all the regions|The feature of synchronizing images across all the supported regions is available in Container Registry \(ACR\) Enterprise Edition. This feature supports automatic image synchronization across different regions. This solves the pain points in the delivery of globalization container application and helps enterprises improve the efficiency of business innovation and iteration. Container Registry Enterprise Edition offers the capabilities of enhanced security protection and large-scale image distribution. It is suitable for enterprise-level customers with high-security requirements and large-scale nodes.|All|None.|
|Multi-zone configuration and 5-master node configuration|Starting from May 2019, ACK allows you to set multiple zones when creating a Kubernetes cluster and set five master nodes for a dedicated Kubernetes cluster. This improves the availability of the Kubernetes clusters.|All|None.|

|Adding support to manage applications in the management console through Istio v1.1.| ACK Istio is upgraded to v1.1. You can manage applications in Kubernetes clusters in which the Istio v1.1 is deployed. You can use the graphic user interface \(GUI\) to create and manage Istio applications and services. In different phases, you can create versions for applications and set various policies. You can also configure fault injection polices to test the resilient ability of your services. In the management console, choose **Service Mesh** \> **Virtual Service** to configure these settings.

Compared with previous FPGA solutions of video encoding acceleration that spends one week, using the Dedicated FPGA Kubernetes clusters can reduce the time to a short time. This significantly saves the CDN bandwidth for the bitrate of transcoding and optimization of non-compression video quality. In the management console, choose **Clusters** \> **Clusters**, and click Create Kubernetes Cluster. On the Select Cluster Template page, select the **Dedicated FPGA Cluster** template to create the Dedicated FPGA Kubernetes cluster.|All|None.|
