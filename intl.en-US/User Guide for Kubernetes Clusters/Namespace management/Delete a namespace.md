-   A cluster is created. For more information, see [Create a cluster of ACK Managed Edition](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster management/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a cluster of ACK Managed Edition.md).
-   A namespace is created. The following example is based on namespace test. For more information, see [Create a namespace](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Namespace management/Create a namespace.md).
