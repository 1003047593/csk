This topic describes how to view a ConfigMap in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

-   An ACK cluster is created. For more information, see [Create a managed kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster management/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a managed kubernetes cluster.md).
-   A ConfigMap is created. For more information, see [Create a ConfigMap](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Serverless Kubernetes Clusters/Config Map/Create a ConfigMap.md).

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, click the name of a cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.
