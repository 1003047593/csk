# Billing {#concept_kjv_shc_5db .concept}

When you use Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\), you are only charged for the cloud resources that you create.

-   If you use a dedicated Kubernetes cluster or a managed Kubernetes cluster, you are charged for the resources that are automatically created by ACK or you manually create. For example, ECS instances, SLB instances, and NAT gateways. For more information about charges for ECS instances, see [Pricing overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#). For more information about charges for SLB instances, see [Billing method](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Billing method.md#).
-   If you use a serverless Kubernetes cluster, you are charged for the resources, such as the ECI instances, SLB instances, and NAT gateways that you create. For more information about the charges for ECI instances, see [Pricing overview](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/89142.html).
