# Billing {#concept_kjv_shc_5db .concept}

Currently, Container Service is free of charge. However, you have to pay for the resources you used, such as ECS instances and Server Load Balancer instances.

In Container Service, the automatically created or manually added ECS instances and Server Load Balancer instances are billed according to the ECS and Server Load Balancer prices respectively. For more information, see [ECS billing method](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/25370.htm) and [Server Load Balancer billing method](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/27692.htm).
