# Billing {#concept_kjv_shc_5db .concept}

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) is free for use. You only need to pay the fees incurred by the cloud resources that you create in ACK.

-   If you are using Dedicated Kubernetes and Managed Kubernetes clusters, you are charged based on the amount of corresponding resources that are automatically created by ACK or that you manually add. These resources include ECS instances, Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, and NAT gateways. For more information about the pricing details of ECS instances and NAT gateways, see [ECS billing overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Billing overview.md#). For more information about the pricing details of SLB instances, see [Billing method](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Billing method.md#).
-   If you are using Serverless Kubernetes clusters, you are charged based on the amount of corresponding resources that are created in the clusters. These resources include ECIs, SLB instances, and NAT gateways. For more information about the pricing details of ECIs, see [Pricing overview](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/89142.html).
