For more information about the Kubernetes vulnerability CVE-2019-11253, see [CVE-2019-11253](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83253).

## Affected versions

-   Kubernetes v1.0.x~1.12.x
-   Kubernetes v1.13.0 to 1.13.11 \(fixed in [1.13.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83436)\)
-   Kubernetes v1.14.0 to 1.14.7 \(fixed in [1.14.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83435)\)

## Fixes

Log on to the [the ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com) to upgrade your ACK clusters to 1.14.8. For more information about how to upgrade an ACK cluster and the considerations to which you must pay attention, see [Upgrade a cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster management/Upgrade cluster/Upgrade a cluster.md).

If you cannot immediately upgrade your ACK clusters, perform the following operations to reduce the risks caused by this vulnerability and perform an upgrade at a later time.

-   You can follow the principle of least privilege \(POLP\) and grant Resource Access Management \(RAM\) users the minimum permissions on the ACK cluster that they need to access. Do not grant the RAM users the permissions to create or modify ACK clusters. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Authorization management/Overview.md).
-   You can also use your Alibaba Cloud account to revoke KubeConfig credentials from users that may be exposed to the risk of disclosing their KubeConfig credentials.
