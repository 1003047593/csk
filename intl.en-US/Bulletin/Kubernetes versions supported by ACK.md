# Kubernetes versions supported by ACK {#concept_1340108 .concept}

To guarantee that you can more easily use Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) that is backed by stable and reliable Kubernetes versions, ACK provides support for multiple Kubernetes versions. Specifically, support is provided for up to four Kubernetes versions at the same time. The maintenance period for each Kubernetes version lasts for one year. For more information, see [Kubernetes versions](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Kubernetes versions.md#).

You must upgrade your Kubernetes clusters before their maintenance period expires.
