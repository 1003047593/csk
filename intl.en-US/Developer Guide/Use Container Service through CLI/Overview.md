You can use Container Service with the Command Line Interface \(CLI\) tool.

The Alibaba Cloud CLI tool is compiled based on Alibaba Cloud OpenAPIs by using the Go language to manage Alibaba Cloud resources. After downloading and configuring this tool, you can use multiple Alibaba Cloud products with a command line method.

For more information, see [Alibaba Cloud CLI](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/66653.htm).
