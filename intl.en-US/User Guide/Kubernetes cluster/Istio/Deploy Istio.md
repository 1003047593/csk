# Deploy Istio {#concept_mpq_kkh_1fb .concept}

To solve problems for the distributed application architecture composed of microservices in dimensions of operation and maintenance, debugging, and security management. you can deploy Istio to create microservice network and to provide load balancing, authentication between services, and monitoring. Istio provides the preceding functions without requiring changes to services.

## Prerequisites {#section_ymx_4kh_1fb .section}

You have created a Kubernetes cluster. For how to create a Kubernetes cluster, see [Create a Kubernetes cluster](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Cluster management/Create a Kubernetes cluster.md#).

## Background information {#section_f1c_rkh_1fb .section}

-   Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes in versions of 1.10.4 and later support Istio deployment. If your Container Service for Kubernetes is in any version prior to 1.10.4, update the version to 1.10.4 or later.

-   To guarantee sufficient resources, the number of worker nodes in a cluster must be greater than or equal to 3.


## Procedure {#section_spk_skh_1fb .section}

**Deploy Istio through a cluster Interface**

1.  Log on to the [Container Service console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cs).
2.  Click **Cluster** in the left-hand navigation pane.
3.  Click **More** \> **Deploy Istio** in the action column at the right of a cluster.

4.  Deploy Istio according to the following information:

    |Configuration|Description|
    |-------------|-----------|
    |Clusters|The target cluster for to which Istio is deployed.|
    |Namespace|The namespace in which Istio is deployed.|
    |Release Name|The name of Istio to be released.|
    |Enable Prometheus for metrics/logs collection|Whether to enable Prometheus for metrics/logs collection. Enabled by default.|

    |Enable ServiceGraph for deployment visualization|Whether to enable ServiceGraph for deployment visualization. Enabled by default.|
    |Enable automatic Istio Sidecar injection|Whether to enable automatic Istio Sidecar injection Enabled by default.|
    |Enable Log Service\(SLS\) and Jaeger| Whether to enable Log Service\(SLS\) and Jaeger This parameter is not enabled by default.

 Endpoint: Select an address based on the region in which the configured Log Service exists. For more information, see [Service endpoint](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Service endpoint.md#section_nv4_h2r_12b).

 Project: The name of the project in which you collect logs.

 Logstore: The name of the Logstore in which you collect logs.

 AccessKeyID: The ID of the Access Key used to access Log Service.

**Note:** Select the AccessKeyID that has permission to access Log Service.

 AccessKeySecret: The Access Key Secret used to access Log Service.
